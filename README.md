These are my solutions to exercises from the book "Structure And Interpretation Of Computer Programs" (SICP). I skipped exercises that were either too trivial or too time consuming (e.g. box-and-pointer diagrams). If time permits, I might get back to them in the future.

To run code: `mit-scheme < file_name.scm`. To load as if in the REPL (useful in the 4th chapter): `mit-scheme --load file_name.scm`.
