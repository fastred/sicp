Suppose we have two streams: infinite and finite one.
If we simply try to append them and then display resulting stream, none of the
elements from the second stream will be reached.
Although it is quite unlikely to work with infinite streams in real systems, I suppose
we may think about them in terms of very long, but finite streams.
If the number of results from the system were limited it would be better to
get at least some results from both streams.
