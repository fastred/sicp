;Arguments are evaluated from right to left. It's in the procedure 'construct-arglist'.
;
;Current complexity of argument list building is O(n). If we were to build
;this list from the beginning appending each new element to the end of the list
;we would end up with O(n^2).

; TODO: code for left to right evaluation
